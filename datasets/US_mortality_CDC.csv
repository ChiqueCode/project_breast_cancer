Caveats:,,,,,
"1. About rate comparisons: <ul><li> For consistency with the data on cancer incidence, the cancer sites in mortality data were",,,,,
"grouped according to the revised SEER recodes dated January 27, 2003 (see SEER Cause of Death Recodes:",,,,,
"http://seer.cancer.gov/codrecode/.). Because NCHS uses different groupings for some sites, the death rates in this report may",,,,,
"differ slightly from those published by NCHS. In addition, under the ICD, there are differences in mortality and incidence",,,,,
"coding. For example, there are several codes for mesothelioma in ICD-10 (depending on the primary site). However in ICD-O-3, one",,,,,
code captures all of the primary sites that mesothelioma affects. Note that Kaposi sarcoma deaths included in this dataset are,,,,,
"only those deaths with underlying cause of death attributed to Kaposi Sarcoma, and do not include deaths where the condition was",,,,,
"a contributing cause of death, or subsequent to another underlying condition. </li><li> The population used to age-adjust the",,,,,
"rates in this report is the 2000 U.S. standard population, which is in accordance with a 1998 recommendation of the US.",,,,,
Department of Health and Human Services. The 2000 U.S. standard population is based on the proportion of the 2000 population in,,,,,
"specific age groups (younger than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-19 years, . . . 85 years or older); the",,,,,
proportions of the 2000 population in these age groups serve as weights for calculating age-adjusted incidence and death rates.,,,,,
"NCHS, however, uses a different set of age groups in its age adjustment of death rates, and thus the cancer death rates in this",,,,,
report may differ slightly from those published by NCHS. </li><li> Deaths of persons of unknown age are not included in this,,,,,
data set. Death rates may differ slightly from other reports where deaths of persons of unknown age are included. </li></ul>,,,,,
"2. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and",,,,,
Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for,,,,,
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national",,,,,
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005.",,,,,
