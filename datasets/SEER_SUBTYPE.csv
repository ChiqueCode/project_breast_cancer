"Data Source:"
"SEER 21 areas [http://seer.cancer.gov/registries/terms.html] (San Francisco, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Utah, Atlanta, San Jose-Monterey, Los Angeles, Alaska Native Registry, Rural Georgia, California excluding SF/SJM/LA, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, Georgia excluding ATL/RG, Idaho, New York and Massachusetts)."
Methodology:
"Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 US Std Population (19 age groups - Census P25-1130)."
"The Annual Percent Change (APC) estimates were calculated from the underlying rates using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software [http://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint], Version 4.6, February 2018, National Cancer Institute."
"The APC's direction is ""rising"" when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, ""falling"" when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is considered stable."
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"Rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives only include cases that are in a Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA). See  SEER Race Recode Documentation for American Indian/Alaskan Native Statistics [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#ai-an]."
"Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are not mutually exclusive from whites, blacks, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. Incidence data for Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are based on the NAACCR Hispanic Latino Identification Algorithm (NHIA) and exclude cases from the Alaska Native Registry. See SEER Race Recode Documentation for Spanish-Hispanic-Latino Ethnicity [http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/#hispanic]."
"Cancer Site Coding:"
"See <a href=""https://seer.cancer.gov/explorer/cancer-sites.html"">SEER*Explorer Cancer Site Definitions</a> for details about the coding used for SEER Incidence data."
