"Data Source:"
"SEER 9 areas [http://seer.cancer.gov/registries/terms.html] (San Francisco, Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Utah, and Atlanta)."
Methodology:
"Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 US Std Population (19 age groups - Census P25-1130)."
"The Annual Percent Change (APC) estimates were calculated from the underlying rates using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software [http://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint], Version 4.6, February 2018, National Cancer Institute."
"The APC's direction is ""rising"" when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, ""falling"" when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is considered stable."
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"For years prior to 1990, the Census Bureau has only provided county-level population estimates for White, Black, and “Other” races."
"Cancer Site Coding:"
"See <a href=""https://seer.cancer.gov/explorer/cancer-sites.html"">SEER*Explorer Cancer Site Definitions</a> for details about the coding used for SEER Incidence data."
