Worldwide cancer data

	⁃	There is a lot of very interesting global information on cancer here; you have to scroll through to see
	⁃	We could also use these metrics as ideas for other correlations (income, GDP, etc)
	⁃	At the bottom are the sources of the data. We could go straight there to see if there is any other data we can use
	⁃	This is one of the sources at the bottom. It’s complicated to use: http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool


UCI ML repository- a solid resource. There are multiple breast cancer datasets here used for determining breast cancer. Some of these might be usable (note the years)
